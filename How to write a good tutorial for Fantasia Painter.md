## How to write a good tutorial for Fantasia Painter

You can write a good tutorial for using Fantasia Painter tools and effects. Have you found a unique way to use the Clone tool? How about achieving a desired effect that's tricky to replicate? You may have a good eye for color, lines, and simply getting the most out of a painting while using the app. Tutorials make it easy to share your tips with other artists. 

For the best results, follow these simple guidelines while writing up your tutorial:

#### Be easy

Break steps down into multiple actions if they're too complicated. The reader should come away with a clear understanding of how to complete your tutorial and be confident the final image/painting will look as it should. No surprises in the final product. If you anticipate there will be surprises or hiccups, point them out clearly so the reader understands what can happen to their image/painting. 

#### Be quick but thorough

Write in short sentences and keep tidy - and short - paragraphs that are easy to read. Keep sentences flowing naturally without too many commas or semicolons. Put the topic of the paragraph in the first sentence. When a reader skims your tutorial, they should understand what each paragraph covers by reading the first line. Use subheadings, lists, bold and emphasis as needed. Explain related options if it's relevant to what can be done within your scenario: *You can change the color of the sticker you just added by sliding the color bar on the bottom right corner.*

#### Be consistent

Use the 'you' pronoun in your writing. *Next, you will select the Fairy Lights brush.* Keep using 'you', 'your', 'you're', etc, throughout the tutorial, so you don't confuse the reader. Continue calling an effect or tool by the same name throughout, don't shorten or abbreviate it.

#### Be concise

Focus on actions the reader should take. Don't slip into a passive voice or meander into topics unrelated to the task of the tutorial. Reduce generic filler words such as 'more', 'sometimes', and 'maybe'. Be specific to the scenario you are illustrating.

#### Be demonstrative. Use pictures and screenshots

Take screenshots of your phone screen by pressing the Volume Up + Power buttons at the same time. Use them to illustrate tricky or hard to explain parts of your tutorial where a visual would be helpful. Use screenshots to show the final product of your tutorial. It should be one of the main attractions for readers. 

#### Edit

Re-read your tutorial and follow the steps. Check for grammar, punctuation and spelling errors. Is there a section that would be better written as a list of steps, rather than paragraph form? Is it easy and engaging to read or is the amount of text too overwhelming?

#### Use the provided template

Follow the structure and additional instructions in the [sample template](sample.md).
