## How to write a good tutorial for Fantasia Painter

You can write a good tutorial for using Fantasia Painter tools and effects. Have you found a unique way to use the Clone tool? How about achieving a desired effect that's tricky to replicate? Or you could have a good eye for color, lines, and simply getting the most out of a painting while using the app. Tutorials make it easy to share your tips with other artists. For the best results, follow these simple guidelines while writing up your tutorial:



#### Be easy.

Break steps down into multiple actions if they're too complicated. The reader should come away with a clear understanding of how to complete your tutorial and be confident the final image/painting will look as it should. No surprises in the final product. If you anticipate that there will be surprises or hiccups, point them out clearly so the reader understands what can happen to their image/painting. 

#### Be quick but thorough.

Write in short sentences and keep tidy - and short - paragraphs that are easy to read. Keep sentences flowing naturally without too many commas or semicolons. If a reader skims your tutorial, they should be able to understand what each paragraph covers if you put the topic of the paragraph in the first sentence. Use subheadings, lists, bold and emphasis as needed. Explain related options if it's relevant to what can be done within your scenario: *You can change the color of the sticker you just added by sliding the color bar on the bottom right corner.*

#### Be consistent.

Use consistent pronouns in  your writing. If you use 'you' -  *Next, you will select the Fairy Lights brush* - then keep using 'you', 'your', 'you're', etc, throughout the tutorial, so you don't confuse the reader. Continue calling an effect or tool by the same name throughout, don't shorten or abbreviate it.

#### Be concise.

Keep your sentences short and concise. Focus on actions the reader should take. Don't slip into a passive voice or meander into topics unrelated to the task of the tutorial. Reduce generic filler words such as 'more', 'sometimes', and 'maybe'. Be specific to the scenario you are illustrating.

#### Be demonstrative. Use pictures and screenshots.

You have the ability to take a screenshot of your phone screen. Use it to illustrate certain tricky or hard to explain parts of your tutorial, where a visual would be helpful. Use screenshots to show the final product of your tutorial. It should be one of the main attractions for readers. 

#### Edit.

Have a friend read it, make sure they can understand and follow the steps. Check for grammar, punctuation and spelling errors. Is there a section that would be better written as a list of steps, rather than paragraph form? Is it easy and engaging to read, or is the amount of text too overwhelming?
