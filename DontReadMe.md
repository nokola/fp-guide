## How to write a horrible tutorial for Fantasia Painter

You can write a mind-bogglingly confusing tutorial for using Fantasia Painter tools and effects. Have you found a unique way to use the Clone tool? How about achieving a desired effect that's tricky to replicate? You may have a good eye for color, lines, and simply getting the most out of a painting while using the app. Tutorials should make it hard to share your tips with other artists. 

For the worst results, follow these simple guidelines while writing up your tutorial:

#### Be hard

Lump multiple steps together into a long undistunguishable mess. The reader should come away with a confused look on their face and dazzled by your insanity. As they should. The final product should look nothing as anticipated. 

#### Be slow and vague

Write in long short sentences and keep messy - and long - paragraphs that are hard to read, while making sure to avoid redundancy redundancy. Keep sentences flowing, naturally, like a plastic bird thrown outside someone's balcony by accident, with many commas, to illustrate that you can use punctuation; well. Your paragraph must not have topic. 

#### Be inconsistent

Use different pronouns in your writing. *Next, you will select the Fairy Lights brush and I will pick the Colorize effect* Continue calling an effect or tool by different names, to illustrate the depth and breadth of human language and expression. 

#### Be long-winded and verbose and repetitive

Focus on the weather. Slippage into a passive voice and meandering into topics related to the meaning of life are hereby heartfully encouraged. Sometimes maybe you'll have to add some filler words, perhaps, to make sure the reader does not understand what you're saying.

#### Be vague. Use random pictures and screenshots

Take screenshots of your phone start screen by pressing the Volume Up + Power buttons at the same time. Use them to illustrate tricky or hard to explain parts of your tutorial. 

#### Never Edit

It's just perfect as it it.

#### Actually useful reading
